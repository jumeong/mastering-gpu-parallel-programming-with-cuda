# 1. GPU vs CPU (very important)
- CPU
  - Powerful ALU
  - Large Cache memory per ALU
  - Good for sequential applications
- GPU
  - Thousands of small ALUs
  - Small caches per core
  - Good for parallelizd applcations
- CPU와 GPU 통신은 PCI Express로

# 2. Nvidia's history

# 3. Architecures and Generations relationshop [Hopper, Ampere, GeForce and Tesla]
- NVIDIA GPU는 크게 두 가지 카테고리로 나뉨 (Standard, HPC GPUs)
- Architecture는 Standard GPU와 HPC 모두로 만들어질 수 있음 (e.g., RTX 3090 and A100)
